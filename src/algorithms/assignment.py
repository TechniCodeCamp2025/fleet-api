"""
Core assignment algorithm - pure logic, no I/O.
Assigns vehicles to routes minimizing total cost while respecting constraints.

IMPROVEMENTS FROM REVIEW:
- Removed chain building by default (spec compliance)
- Implemented actual service scheduling
- Fixed annual lease cycle reset
- Added relation caching
- Optimized swap policy checks
- Replaced magic numbers with constants/config
- Added validation and better error handling
- Added progress reporting
- Fixed service timing consistency
- Added workload balancing
- Extracted relation lookup helper
